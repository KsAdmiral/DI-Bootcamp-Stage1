            Keanu Charles Reeves (/kiˈɑːnuː/ kee-AH-noo; born September 2, 1964)
            is a Canadian actor. Born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, Reeves
            began acting in theatre productions and in television films before
            making his feature film debut in Youngblood (1986). He had his
            breakthrough role in the science fiction comedy Bill & Ted's
            Excellent Adventure (1989), and he reprised his role in its sequels.
            He gained praise for playing a hustler in the independent drama My
            Own Private Idaho (1991) and established himself as an action hero
            with leading roles in Point Break (1991) and Speed (1994). Following
            several box office failures, Reeves's performance in the horror film
            The Devil's Advocate (1997) was well received. Greater stardom came
            for playing Neo in the science fiction series The Matrix, beginning
            in 1999. He played John Constantine in Constantine (2005) and
            starred in the romantic drama The Lake House (2006), the science
            fiction thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), and the crime
            thriller Street Kings (2008). Following another commercially down
            period, Reeves made a successful comeback by playing the titular
            assassin in the John Wick film series, beginning in 2014. In
            addition to acting, Reeves has directed the film Man of Tai Chi
            (2013). He has played bass guitar for the band Dogstar and pursued
            other endeavours such as writing and philanthropy.<br />
